    <button onclick="trans()">The Common European Framework of References for Languages (CEFR) is an international
        standard for language
        ability and comprehension. This standard includes 6 distinct English levels: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2. Some
        institutions also recognize the pre-A1 level, though it is not as common. What do these designations actually
        mean about your English abilities?</button>

            The A1 level refers to speakers who have a basic grasp of the English
            language. If you are at the A1 level, you can understand some common phrases and words in English. You can
            ask and answer simple questions (i.e. How old are you? Where do you live? Whatâ€™s your favorite color?).
